# Coding Interview Excersises

## What's this?
This project is meant to show us a bit of your coding abilities by doing instead of talking. There are three small excersises. Don't worry about getting too technical, it's important for us to see the way in which you think and not what kind of libraries/complex stuff you're using :)

## How should I proceed?
1. Fork this repository and then clone it.
2. Open it with the IDE of your choosing.
3. Run `npm intall` to install existing dependencies.
4. Complete the excersises located at `src/functions.js`. Please, let us know your reasoning while doing so.
5. Complete tests for your new code at `tests/functions.test.js` 
6. When you're finished, just push to your new repo and send a PR to us.

We hope you have fun with this little excersise. Good luck!
